    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p><em>Effective Date: March 23, 2025</em></p>
    <p><em>Last Updated: March 23, 2025</em></p>

    <p>Welcome to Playgrounds, a map-based social network ("App") developed and operated by Fluxe Labs, a company based in Toronto, Canada. By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the App. These Terms govern your use of Playgrounds and place significant responsibility on you for your actions and content.</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By creating an account or using the App, you confirm that you are at least 13 years old, have the legal capacity to enter into this agreement, and accept these Terms in full. We may update these Terms at our discretion, and changes take effect upon posting here. Your continued use of the App after updates constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of the App</h2>
    <p>Playgrounds allows you to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Create posts by placing custom markers on a map (powered by Mapbox), reflecting your location at the time of post creation (no live location tracking occurs).</li>
        <li>Add an "attend" button to your posts, allowing other users to indicate attendance. Only the post creator can view the list of attendees for that specific post, and only users who click "attend" are included.</li>
        <li>Comment on other users’ posts.</li>
        <li>Follow or unfollow other users.</li>
        <li>Edit your profile (e.g., username, bio, avatar).</li>
        <li>Filter posts to view only those from users you follow.</li>
        <li>Search for posts by categories.</li>
        <li>Delete your account at any time via the Account settings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These features are provided "as is," and we reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the App without notice or liability.</p>

    <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
    <p>You must create an account to use Playgrounds. You are solely responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Providing an accurate email address at signup (it cannot be changed in the App).</li>
        <li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials.</li>
        <li>All activities under your account, whether authorized by you or not.</li>
        <li>Remembering your password. We do not offer in-app password recovery; contact <a href="mailto:playgroundshello@gmail.com">playgroundshello@gmail.com</a> for assistance, subject to our discretion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We are not liable for losses or damages due to your failure to secure your account or remember your password. Notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:playgroundshello@gmail.com">playgroundshello@gmail.com</a> if you suspect unauthorized access.</p>

    <h2>4. User Content and Conduct</h2>
    <p>You may create posts, comments, profile content, and opt into attendable events ("User Content"). You are entirely responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensuring your User Content is lawful, accurate, and appropriate.</li>
        <li>The location data you attach to posts, which you consent to share and make visible to other users via Mapbox as part of the App’s functionality.</li>
        <li>Choosing to add an "attend" button to your posts and managing the visibility of attendees (limited to you as the creator). If you click "attend" on another post, you consent to your username being visible solely to that post’s creator.</li>
        <li>Not posting content that is defamatory, obscene, harassing, hateful, infringing, or otherwise violates any law or third-party rights.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not pre-screen User Content but may remove or suspend access to any content or account at our sole discretion, without notice, if we believe it violates these Terms or is harmful. You grant Fluxe Labs a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, display, and store your User Content solely to operate the App, including processing map data via Mapbox.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use Mapbox to provide map functionality and Supabase for secure data storage. Your post location data is processed by Mapbox to display markers, and all data is stored in Supabase. By using the App, you agree to their respective terms (Mapbox: <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/legal/tos">mapbox.com/legal/tos</a>; Supabase: <a href="https://supabase.com/terms">supabase.com/terms</a>) where applicable. We are not responsible for their services or any issues arising from their use.</p>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>The App, including its design, code, and branding, is owned by Fluxe Labs and protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws. You may not copy, modify, distribute, or reverse-engineer the App. User Content remains your property, but you permit us to use it as described in Section 4.</p>

    <h2>7. Prohibited Activities</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the App for illegal purposes or to harm others.</li>
        <li>Impersonate any person or entity.</li>
        <li>Spam, harass, or stalk other users, including via comments or attendable posts.</li>
        <li>Introduce viruses, malware, or any code to disrupt the App.</li>
        <li>Attempt to access accounts, data, or attendees lists not belonging to you.</li>
        <li>Use automated tools (e.g., bots) to scrape or manipulate the App.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Violations may result in immediate account termination and potential legal action.</p>

    <h2>8. Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>You may delete your account at any time via the Account settings, subject to confirmation ("Are you sure?"). Deletion is irreversible and removes all your User Content, including posts and attendees data, from our systems within 30 days, except as required by law. We are not responsible for preserving your data post-deletion.</p>

    <h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available," without warranties of any kind, express or implied (e.g., fitness for a particular purpose, uninterrupted service). We do not guarantee:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The accuracy or reliability of User Content, post locations, or attendees lists.</li>
        <li>That the App, Mapbox, or Supabase will be error-free or always accessible.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You use the App at your own risk, and we are not liable for any damages arising from your reliance on it.</p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Fluxe Labs, its affiliates, and employees are not liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages (e.g., loss of data, profits, or emotional distress) arising from your use of the App, even if advised of the possibility. Our total liability, if any, is limited to $50 CAD.</p>

    <h2>11. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify and hold Fluxe Labs harmless from any claims, damages, or expenses (including legal fees) arising from your use of the App, your User Content, your interactions with attendable posts, or your violation of these Terms. This survives termination of your account.</p>

    <h2>12. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your account at our sole discretion, with or without cause or notice, including for violations of these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the App ceases immediately, and we may delete your data per our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>13. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of Ontario, Canada, excluding conflict-of-law principles. Any disputes must be resolved in the courts of Ontario, Canada, and you consent to their exclusive jurisdiction. You waive any objection to venue or inconvenience.</p>

    <h2>14. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>For questions or concerns about these Terms, email us at <a href="mailto:playgroundshello@gmail.com">playgroundshello@gmail.com</a>. We aim to respond within 30 days.</p>

    <h2>15. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>If any part of these Terms is found invalid, the rest remains enforceable. Our failure to enforce any provision is not a waiver. These Terms, alongside our Privacy Policy, constitute the entire agreement between you and Fluxe Labs regarding the App.</p>
